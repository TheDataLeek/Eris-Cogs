    A local kenku street gang comes into the tavern. They try to sell traveler’s dust to the patrons. (Traveler’s Dust: Tiny roseate crystals. A single grain is usually dropped into the eye, where it dissolves. Those using it are said to be walking the crimson road. Those using traveler’s dust often have trembling hands, slurred speech, and eyes the color of blood. Creates a euphoric feeling paired to a sensation of the world slowing down around you.)
    PCs walk in to find a horse standing in the middle of the common room. No one can explain how it got there or who owns it.
    A patron slips a drug into a drink before returning to their own table.
    A 12-year-old pickpocket named Stannis is working the crowd. His handler, a half-orc named Sabeen, is waiting outside.
    A portal opens in the middle of the tavern. An elven wizard named Kyser Tameno walks out, orders a drink, and goes back through the portal. (He might become a regular.)
    The City Watch makes an arrest on the premises.
    Volo shows up and would like to make arrangements for a signing of Volo’s Guide to Monsters. Also has a number of questions regarding the haunting of Trollskull Manor for Volo’s Guide to Spirits and Specters.
