# Eris' Cogs
Welcome to my cogs! If you have any questions please [join my discord!](http://discord.gg/ee3NyDq)

The table below lists all available cogs, as well as their current state. If a cog is listed as 'not ready' that simply means that I haven't gone through to productionalize / standardize the code. They still work, I just haven't cleaned them up entirely yet. Use at your own risk!

If you're on windows, you'll need to delete the symlinked `eris_event_lib.py` files in the directories of the cogs you wish to install and replace it with a copy of the root-level file.
